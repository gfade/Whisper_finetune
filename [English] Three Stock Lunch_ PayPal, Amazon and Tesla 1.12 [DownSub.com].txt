DOWN 60% FOR THE YEAR.

DAVID KATZ IS A CHIEF INVESTMENT

OFFICER.

I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHERE YOU 

COME DOWN ON THEM.

LET'S START WITH PAYPAL.

>> AFTER THE CARNAGE IN 

TECHNOLOGY TO YEAR, THERE ARE A 

LOT OF TECHNOLOGY STOCKS THAT 

ARE FALLING INTO THE VALUE CAMP.

PAYPAL, ONE OF OUR FAVORITE 

STOCKS RIGHT NOW

THEY HAVE A GREAT LONG-TERM 

FRANCHISE MANAGEMENT THAT'S 

FINALLY GETTING IT

THEY'VE GOT TO CONTROL COSTS

17 TIMES THIS YEAR'S EARNINGS,

WE THINK THE BUSINESS IS GOING

TO DO WELL

GREAT PRICE.

THIS IS SOMETHING WE WOULD BE 

BUYING PRETTY AGGRESSIVELY

WE WOULD ALSO BE BUYING IT

BEFORE YEAR END BECAUSE WE THINK

IT'S UNDER A LOT OF TAX SELLING 

PRESSURE AND WINDOW DRESSING

WE THINK YOU'RE GETTING A GREAT 

BUSINESS AT A GREAT PRICE.

>> RINGING ENDORSEMENT FOR

PAYPAL

>> WHAT ABOUT AMAZON, SORT OF 

P

PAYPAL-ISH

>> AMAZON IS TOUGHER TO VALUE 

BUT WE LOOK AT IT ON A PRICE TO 

SALES BASIS AND THAT HAS GOTTEN 

DOWN TO LEVELS THAT ARE PRETTY

ATTRACTIVE

IT SELLS AT ABOUT 1.65 TIMES ITS

SALES OVER THE LAST FIVE AND TEN

YEARS IT SOLD BETWEEN 2 TO

3 1/2, SO THIS IS ANOTHER ONE 

THAT WE'LL BE AGGRESSIVELY

BUYING

WE WOULD BE BUYING IT HERE

WE THINK IT'S PROBABLY GOT ABOUT

30% TO 50% UPSIDE IN THE

UPCOMING YEAR.

SAME WITH PAYPAL. 

>> A BIG FAN OF AMAZON AS WELL

IN A YEAR THAT PEOPLE THINK WE

COULD BE TALKING ABOUT

RECESSION.

>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY THE CASE.

WE THINK THAT EVEN THOUGH WE

MIGHT HAVE A RECESSION, STOCKS

ARE GOING TO BE VALUED ON THE 

RECOVERY AS THE YEAR PROGRESSES 

AND WE THINK ON A RECOVERY

PAYPAL AND AMAZON WILL BE VERY

SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. 

>> SO WHAT ABOUT TESLA

>> SO WE'RE LESS ENTHUSIASTIC 

THERE.

THE STOCK HAS FINALLY COME DOWN 

TO LEVELS WHERE THE VALUATION IS

NO LONGER OBSCENE, BUT WE STILL 

THINK THE CEO IS DEFINITELY 

DOING DAMAGE TO THE FRANCHISE 

WITH WHAT HE'S DOING AT TWITTER.

IT NO LONGER IS A GREAT THING TO

OWN A TESLA CAR BECAUSE A LOT OF

PEOPLE ARE LESS FOND OF MUSK

WE ALSO THINK THEY HAVE 

COMPETITION.

WE THINK RELATIVE TO OTHER

AUTOMOBILE COMPANIES IT'S STILL 

SELLING AT A RICH VALUATION.

WE THINK IT'S GOING TO HAVE A 

BOUNCE AT THE BEGINNING OF THI
