RELEASE THIRD QUARTER RESULTS.

THEY'RE EXPECTED TO BE STRONG 

SURROUNDING THE CLOUD BUSINESS

AND AI

JOINING US WITH MORE IS AVA 

ADOS

AVA, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON ORACLE?

>> IT IS A BUY

IT WAS OUR NUMBER ONE WAY WHEN

THE MARKET REWARDED PROFITS OVER

GROWTH

I THINK IT'S STILL UNDERSTOOD 

VALUED ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES 

TO GENERATIVE AI

THEY CAN USE THE HUGE MARKET

SHARE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER AI

PLAYERS.

THAT GIVES THEM A GROWTH SPACE

WHAT'S INTERESTING ABOUT THIS 

COMPANY IT'S CHANGING FROM A

VALUE PLAY BACK TO GROWTH PLAY

AFTER SO MANY YEARS.

I'M VERY EXCITED ABOUT THE

COMPANY.

I THINK THERE'S STILL ROOM TO 

GROW. 

>> LET'S SEE IF THERE'S AS MUCH 

ENTHUSIASM FOR BIOGEN.

SHARES ARE UP ABOUT 14% THIS

YEAR

AVA, WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH IT

>> I WOULD BUY, BUT FOR THE 

SHORT TERM

NOT AS MUCH EXCITEMENT HERE 

BECAUSE I RECOGNIZE THAT CAN BE 

A SHORT-TERM CATALYST WITH THE

FDA NEWS

THE STOCK MIGHT DO GREAT IN THE 

NEXT COUPLE MONTHS, BUT FOR THE 

LONG TERM, IF YOU LOOK AT THE 

LAST THREE TO FOUR YEARS, 

THEY'VE BEEN ON A DOWNWARD

DECLINE.

THEIR MARGINS ARE SHRINKING.

I WOULDN'T HOLD IT FOR THE LONG 

TERM

I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

SHORT-TERM PLAY.

>> FINALLY, AVA, SENTINEL ONE,

SHARES ARE UP 8%

MORGAN STANLEY UPGRADING THE

STOCK, BUT THE STOCK IS STILL 

DOWN NEARLY 30% FOR THE MONTH 

BECAUSE OF A MISS IN QUARTERLY

REVENUE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK HERE

>> IT'S A HOLD BECAUSE IT'S 

DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE

LAST MONTH

IT'S PRICED OKAY, BUT I DO LIKE 

THE CATEGORY

I LIKE GROWTH AND I LIKE

SPECULATIVE COMPANIES AT THE

CURRENT MARKET

I THINK THE CURRENT MARKET IS 

BENEFITTING THESE TYPE OF 

COMPANIES.

HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO 

COMPETITION, IT HAS GREAT 

COMPETITION WITH CROWD STRIKE,

SO I DON'T LIKE THE COMPETITION.

I DO NOT LIKE THEIR MARGINS.

THEY'RE THE LOWEST IN THE
