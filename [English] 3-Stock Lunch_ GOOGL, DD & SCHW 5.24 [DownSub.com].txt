LAID OUT PLANS TO RAMP UP ITS 

CHATGPT RIVAL BARED.

HERE WITH OUR TRADES ARI, 

OPPENHEIMER MANAGING DIRECTOR.

WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON ALPHABET

>> THE TECHNICAL TRENDS ARE 

GOING THE OPPOSITE WAY AS FAR AS

VERSUS THAT DOWNGRADE THAT THEY 

ARE STILL FAVORABLE.

GENERALLY SPEAKING UNDERLYING 

MARKET TRENDS RIGHT HERE ARE

POINTING GROWTH OVER VALUE THAN 

DEFENSE OVER OFFENSE AND I THINK

THESE GROWTH STOCKS STILL STAND 

TO LIFT THE MARKET HIGHER OVER

THE COMING MONTHS.

LOOKING AT ALPHABET THE STOCK 

H

HAS LAGGED THROUGH THIS RECOVERY

AND I THINK LAST WEEK'S STRENGTH

WAS CONFIRMATION OF THE TURN

THAT MARKED A MEANINGFUL

BREAKOUT IN TREND, BUYING 

WEAKNESS DOWN TO THE BREAKOUT 

LEVEL AROUND 109 AND THE UPSIDE 

$130 OVER THE COMING MONTHS 

WHERE THE STOCK STARTED TO BREAK

DOWN WHEN THIS GOT STARTED

SELLING IN THE FIRST PART OF

2022. 

>> HAD A GREAT WEEK.

LET'S TALK ABOUT -- WE DON'T

RARELY MENTION, THE SHARES UP 3%

AFTER DEUTSCHE BANK UPGRADED

THEM TO A BUY, I BELIEVE

THEY'RE BASICALLY SAYING THAT 

THE STOCK IS TRADING AT A 50% 

DISCOUNT TO ITS PEERS AND GONE

THROUGH SEVEN YEARS OF MASSIVE

CHANGES, IS NOW THE MOMENT

>> WE DON'T THINK SO

YOU KNOW, TECHNICAL TRENDS ARE

LESS UPBEAT.

WE TEND TO THINK THERE'S

RELATIVE RISK AND RELATIVE

WEAKNESS

THIS STOCK HAS BEEN A DRIVER OF 

WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET

IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT MARKET

BREADTH YOU HAVE TO BE WORRIED

ABOUT AREAS CAUSING THAT

WEAKNESS

WITH THE MOVE LOWER IN DUPONT 

THAT COMPLETED A PATTERN THAT'S 

BEEN PLAYING OUT SINCE NOVEMBER.

WE WOULD BE SELLING THE STRENGTH

BACK INTO THE BREAKDOWN LEVEL AT

AROUND $67 WITH SOME POTENTIAL

DOWNSIDE RISK TO $60 OVER THE 

COMING MONTHS.

>> LET'S MOVE ON TO CHARLES 

SCHWAB FINALLY, THE BROKERAGE 

FIRM UP 5% AFTER RAYMOND JAMES

SAID SCHAUB'S CORE BANKING

BUSINESS REMAINS STRONG WHICH 

COULD HELP THE STOCK GAIN AS

MUCH AS 30%.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

>> I THINK YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT

MORE UPSIDE HERE

UNSURE ABOUT 30%

GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'VE ARGUED 

IT'S BEEN LESS ABOUT

CONCENTRATED BUYING IN THE TECH 

SECTOR AND THE RESILIENCE OF THE

MARKET WITHIN THE FINANCIAL 

SECTOR AND CHARLES SCHWAB, OF 

COURSE, HAS BEEN WEIGHED DOWN 

WITH THIS BROAD-BASED WEAKNESS

IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR.

WE'RE CURRENTLY ON THE

SIDELINES.

I THINK THE STOCK HAS STABILIZED

FROM OVERSOLD CONDITIONS

THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE DONE

OVER THE COMING MONTHS AND

RESISTANCE OVERHEAD.

WITH THIS RECENT DOUBLE BOTTOM

AROUND $46, I THINK IT'S CAPPED 

AROUND $60 WHICH IS WHERE THE 

STOCK STARTED TO BREAK DOWN IN

THAT
