5% MORE THAN

5% AFTER A STATEMENT BY WALT

BETTINGER WHO SAYS BUSINESS IS

EXTREMELY ROBUST

HERE TO HELP US TRADE THEM ALL

IS THE CHIEF INVESTMENT FROM

JEWEL FINANCIAL.

LET'S START WITH EXXONMOBIL AND 

THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT 

BUY PIONEER.

THE STOCK LITTLE MOVED ON THIS

NEWS

>> YEAH.

I LIKE THIS A LOT.

I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE OF THIS

IN THE SPACE

YOU HAVE COMPANIES THAT ARE NOW 

IN BETTER FINANCIAL POSITION

THAN THEY'VE EVER BEEN

EXXON HUGE CASH SURPLUS, ALREADY

RETURNING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT

OF THAT CAPITAL THROUGH 

DIVIDENDS, SURING UP THEIR

BALANCE SHEET.

PIONEER IN THE SAME SITUATION.

WHAT BETTER USE OF THAT CAPITAL 

THAN TO EXPAND THEIR FOOTPRINT

PIONEER IS A HUGE PLAYER IN THE 

PERMIAN.

THAT GIVES THEM ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES.

I THINK IT'S A GREAT PLAY.

I THINK INVESTORS CAN GET BROAD 

EXPOSURE INSTEAD OF TRYING TO 

PICK THE NEXT TARGET AND BUY THE

XLE, JUST GET BROAD BLANKET 

EXPOSURE TO THE WHOLE GROUP.

I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE M&A

ACTIVITY

>> ESPECIALLY IF THE ACQUIRERS

ARE NOT SEPARATING DOWN.

MICRON IS UP SHARPLY AFTER NEWS 

WITH SAMSUNG

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT STOCK

>> YOU KEEP ACCUMULATING THE

DIPS

WE DON'T ALWAYS GET THEM RIGHT, 

BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS

NAME AFTER THEIR EARNINGS 

ANNOUNCEMENT A FEW WEEKS AGO

WHERE THEY MISSED AND THE STOCK 

WENT UP.

THE REASON THEY WENT UP IS THEY 

TALKED ABOUT THE CYCLE SLOWDOWN 

COMING NEAR AN END

THAT WAS POSITIVE FOR THE NEWS

WE SAID DON'T CHASE IT BUT LOOK 

TO ACCUMULATE ON PULLBACKS

WE GOT THAT PULLBACK, NOW WE'RE 

GETTING A NICE SPARK HERE.

ULTIMATELY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT 

A FUNDAMENTAL BEAST.

THIS COMPANY HAS BEEN SEEING A

COMPOUND ANNUAL GROWTH IN THEIR 

RETURN ON EQUITY OF ABOUT 20%.

THEY'VE BEEN GROWING INTRINSIC

VALUE OF ABOUT 20% FOR THE LAST 

SEVERAL YEARS.

THE STOCK PRICE HAS NOT 

REFLECTED THAT YET

WE SUSPECT THAT WILL HAPPEN.

LOOK FOR A BREAKOUT.

YOU CAN PUT YOUR TECHNICAL HAT

ON HERE, OVER 65 AND I THINK

WE'LL GET A LITTLE FOMO.

I THINK YOU CAN STILL BUY IT

HERE EVEN ON TODAY'S MOVE.

>> CHARLES SCHWAB HAS BEEN

BELEAGUERED, TARRED BY THE BRUSH

THAT HAS HIT SOME OF THE MID

SIZE BANKS AND SO FORTH.

WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS ONE?

>> THIS ONE HITS CLOSE TO HOME

WE'RE A FIDUCIARY ADVISER, WE 

USE THEM AS A CUSTODIAN.

THEIR BROKERAGE SIDE IS 

EXTREMELY STRONG

I DON'T SEE CHALLENGES THERE

THEIR BANKING SIDE, THAT MIGHT

BE CONCERNING.

THAT CLEARLY IS WHY THE STOCK IS

TRADING WHERE IT IS.

HOWEVER, IF YOU DIG DEEPER AND

YOU CAN LOOK AT THE BOND ACTION 

AND THE BOND PRICES ARE NOT 

REFLECTING THE DISTRESS THAT WE 

SEE IN THE EQUITY SIDE

SO, WE THINK THIS COULD BE AN 

OVERBLOWN AND AN OPPORTUNITY

THAT SAID, I THINK A LOT OF 

THESE BANKS THAT ARE UNDERGOING 

THIS PRESSURE, I THINK YOU DON'T

HAVE TO SORT OF ACT IN HASTE AND

YOU CAN WAIT TO SEE A LITTLE BIT

MORE CLARITY ON WHAT THE FDIC 

AND TREASURY WILL DO WITH THE 

INSURED LIMITS

MAKE NO MISTAKE, WHAT WALT IS 

DOING AND SAYING IS SMART.

THIS IS AN AREA WHERE WE LOOK TO

ACQUIRE IF WE GOT MORE CLARITY

ON THE INSURED LIMITS.

>> LET'S TALK MORE BROADLY ABOUT

THE MARKETS RIGHT NOW AND WHAT

YOUR VIEW OF THEM IS

THEY FEEL A LITTLE TENTATIVE, 

MAYBE SQUISHY TODAY, LITTLE 

CHANGED AFTER FRIDAY'S JOBS 

REPORT

>> YEAH.

WE'RE WAITING ON CPI AND PPI, 

THE INFLATION DATA AND THE FOMC 

MINUTES.

WE SEE THERE'S A LOT OF 

FUNDAMENTAL STRENGTH OUT THERE

THERE'S A LOT OF NEGATIVITY 

BAKED IN GOING INTO EARNINGS

SEASON

I DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE GIVING 

THE RESPECT OF THIS RECENT UP 

MOVE WE'VE SEEN, SPECIFICALLY IN

BIG CAP TECH

WE'VE BEEN BUYERS IN HERE.

WE CONTINUE TO BE LONG

WE'RE NOT NEARLY AS PESSIMISTIC 

AS OTHER FOLKS OUT THERE

WE THINK INFLATION WILL CONTINUE

TO SHOW SIGNS OF A DECLINE, AND
