10%.

IT WARNED SECOND QUARTER COMPS

COULD BE UNFAVORABLE

CEO SAID, OUR HOPE IS PRICES

DON'T GO UP, ESPECIALLY IN THIS 

ECONOMY.

HERE WITH OUR TRADES TODAY IS 

VICTORIA GREEN

GREAT TO SEE YOU, VICTORIA

WOULD YOU BE A BUYER OF AIRBNB

>> I AM.

THEY'VE HAD SOME GREAT SUPPORT

TODAY'S A BLOOD BATH, BUT 

GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE

OPTIMISTIC ON THE STOCK.

WE THINK THE STOCK OFFERS A LOT 

OF VALUE

YOU'RE SEEING TRAVEL COME BACK

TO THE CITIES AND 

INTERNA

INTERNATIONALLY.

I LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, SAY

PEOPLE ARE GETTING SQUEEZED AND 

YOU'RE A FAMILY LOOKING TO

TRAVEL, IT'S MORE COST EFFECTIVE

THAN A HOTEL FOR A LARGE FAMILY.

I LIKE OUR SUPPORTS.

I LIKE WHERE THEY'RE GOING

IT'S A WELL-ROUND COMPANY.

FOR ME IT'S STILL A BUY.

>> AND A PROFIT.

SIMILAR STORY FOR TRULIA, WEAK

GUIDANCE IS THE CAUSE OF THE

SHARES HEADING DOWN.

NOT GUIL

 THE STOCK IS DOWN 14%, WORST 

DAY IN SIX MONTHS, WHAT DO YOU

THINK?

>> THIS FOR ME IS NOT A BUY 

HERE

I'M A SELL

THIS STOCK IS DOWN 80% OFF IT 

2022 HIGH.

THEIR CORE BUSINESS IS MATURING 

AND YOU'RE SEEING SLOWING SALES,

A SLOWING CUSTOMER BASE.

WHEN YOU SEE A BUSINESS TRYING

TO BRING ON NEW PRODUCT LINES 

AND TRYING TO EXPAND, THEY'RE 

GOING TO HAVE TO SPEND MONEY TO 

GET THEM INTEGRATED.

EVEN WITH THEIR STAFF REDUCTION 

OF 17%, I SEE THEM PRESSURED ON 

MARGINS.

IT'S NOT SOMETHING I CAN GET

BEHIND WHEN THEY'RE SAYING

THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE SLOWER

GROWTH. 

>> LET'S MOVE TO "THE NEW YORK

TIMES," ADDING NEARLY 200,000 

DIGITAL SUBSCRIBERS, BUT

ADMITTING THERE'S ADVERTISEMENT 

LOSSES

THEY'RE UP 12% SINCE JANUARY

1st.

WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THIS STOCK

>> I CAN'T BUY IT HERE EITHER.

AD REVENUE IS DONE 8.6%.

THEY MENTIONED, WELL, OUR RATE

OF COST GROWTH IS SLOWING.

NOT THAT COSTS ARE GOING DOWN,

BUT RATE OF COST GROWTH IS

SLOWING.

THEY ARE STRUGGLING TO GET AD 

REVENUE.

THIS MIGHT NOT BE AS STICKY A 

SUBSCRIPTION AS THEY WOULD LIKE 

IT TO BE

IF PEOPLE ARE PRESSURED 

ECONOMICALLY, THEY LOOK AT THIS 

DISCRE

DISCRETIONARY INCOME BEING CUT

WE MAY SEE SLOWER SUBSCRIBER

GROWTH AND BAD AD
