THREE-STOCK LUNCH.

TRADING THE TRILLION DOLLAR CLUB

IS DAVID WAGNER.

DAVID, WELCOME BACK.

IT'S GOOD THEO SEE YOU AGAIN.

LET'S START WITH NVIDIA.

ARE YOU A BUYER HERE

>> I LIKE NVIDIA LONG-TERM HERE,

BUT I THINK INVESTORS NEED TO 

UNDERSTAND THAT PRICE VOLATILITY

MAY BE THE NORM MOVING FORWARD, 

ESPECIALLY GIVEN CURRENT

VALUATIONS

I MEAN, IN THIS AI SPACE, 

THERE'S GOING TO BE WINNERS.

THERE'S GOING TO BE LOSERS, BUT 

IT'S A HUGE MARKET, BUT THERE'S 

GOING TO BE WILD PRICES AND 

CRAZY VALUATIONS AND WHAT DOES

NVIDIA HAVE?

PROBABLY CRAZY VALUATIONS IN THE

EYES OF MOST PEOPLE, AND IT'S 

IMPORTANT THAT INVESTORS NEED TO

UNDERSTAND THE BULK CASE AROUND 

HOPPER BECAUSE I DO THINK THAT

GPUs MOVING FORWARD ARE GOING TO

CONTINUE TO DRIVE POSITIVE

EARNINGS REVISIONS

THERE'S NEVER BEEN A DATA CENTER

SALES CYCLE THAT HAS LASTED LESS

THAN ONE YEAR.

IT SHOULDN'T BE A ONE-EVENT OF

EARNINGS AND THEN THEY FALL OFF 

A CLIFF.

I THINK THIS IS SUSTAINABLE,

PARDON ME, BUT THE BIGGEST POINT

I CAN MAKE IS THERE'S PROBABLY

GOING TO BE AIR POCKETS IN THIS 

NAME MOVING FORWARD.

THAT'S THE RISK OF BUYING THIS

IF THERE IS AN AIR POCKET WHICH 

IS PROBABLY INEVITABLE, THE 

STOCK COULD PULL BACK, YOU KNOW,

20%, BUT I DO LIKE NVIDIA HERE

THOUGH I RECENTLY TRIMMED IT

BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SUBJECT 

MY INVESTORS TO ALL THAT

VOLATILE I. 

>> LET'S MOVE ONTO ANOTHER ONE

THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE 

COMPANY, THAT WOULD BE APPLE

SITTING AT A MARKET CAP OF

$2.8 TRILLION LEADING THE 

EXCLUSIVE TRILLION DOLLAR CLUB

DO YOU SEE MORE UPSIDE HERE FOR 

APPLE OR ARE YOU MORE CAUTIOUS

>> THERE'S A LOT OF CONVICTED 

PIECE FOR APPLE.

IT'S POLARIZING.

IT'S NOT A NAME I'LL BE BETTING 

AGAINST FROM A TECHNICAL

PERSPECTIVE.

WHILE THAT PERSPECTIVE IS STRONG

HERE, EVEN AT VALUATIONS, I 

THINK THAT AR/VR FRONT IN THE 

DEVELOPER CONFERENCE WILL BE THE

FOCUS.

IT MAY NOT BE A LARGE FINANCIAL 

IMPACT, YOU KNOW, IN THE

NEAR-TERM, BUT FROM A SENTIMENT 

PERSPECTIVE, IT CAN SHOW THAT 

APPLE CAN INNOVATE

I'M NOT BETTING AGAINST THIS

NAME. 

>> FOR OUR THIRD STOCK, WE ASKED

YOU TO PICK A COMPANY THAT YOU

THINK COULD JOIN THE TRILLION 

DOLLAR CLUB.

WHAT IS IT

>> IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE

WHILE.

IT'S ONLY ABOUT $500 BILLION IN 

MARKET CAP RIGHT NOW, BUT IT'S

GOING TO BE VISA

I BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW, THE 

COMBINATION OF DOUBLE-DIGIT 

REVENUE GROWTH AND MID-TEEN EPS 

GROWTH AND A SIZABLE DISCOUNT 

VERSUS ITS HISTORICAL MULTIPLES 

IS DEFINITELY A REASON TO REMAIN

INVESTED

IT CHECKS A LOT OF BOXES FOR

THIS TYPE OF MARKET ENVIRONMENT 

RIGHT NOW.

ALL TOLD, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY 

PROTECT THE BOTTOM LINE IN A

VARIETY OF MACRO SCENARIOS

ALONGSIDE ITS VALUATION THAT'S

ONLY 30% VERSUS THE S&P ON A

PREMIUM 500 STANDPOINT

WHEN IT'S TRADED AT A PREMIUM,
