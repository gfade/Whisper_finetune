>>> IT'S TIME FOR TODAY'S THREE 

STOCK LUNCH: NVIDIA, JUMPING 7% 

P. BARCLAYS UP SIDE FOR THE 

SECTOR

SPOTIFY, AFTER THEIR PLAN TO LAY

OFF 6% OF THE GLOBAL WORK FORCE,

AND SALESFORCE, SHARES UP 3% ON 

BIG NEWS OF ACTIVIST INVESTOR 

TAKING A MULTIMILLION DOLLAR

STAKE IN THE COMPANY

I LOVE THIS, YOU'RE A PURIST

YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE AN 

OPINION ON WHAT'S GOING ON AT 

SALESFORCE, JUST AN OPINION ON

THE STOCK.

LET'S START WITH NVIDIA, WHAT DO

YOU SEE?

>> YEAH, NVIDIA, THIS IS ONE OF 

THE KEY REASONS OF WHY WE THINK 

THAT THE 2022 BEAR CYCLE IS 

COMING TO AN END

WE'RE SEEING A BROADENING LIST

OF THE RIGHT STOCKS THAT ARE

REVERSING HIGHER

SEMICONDUCTORS INCLUDED.

WE UPGRADED THE SEMICONDUCTOR 

INDUSTRY TO OVERWEIGHT A WEEK 

AND A HALF TAGO.

TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO CYCLICALITY.

NVIDIA IS ONE OF SEVERAL NAMES

IN THE GROUP

IF YOU LOOK ACROSS THE INDUSTRY,

YOU HAVE SEVERAL NAMES MOVING 

ABOUT THEIR 200A AVERAGE, 

REVERSING THEIR PRIOR DECLINE,

AND WE THINK THAT STRENGTH

CONTINUES.

LOOKING AT NVIDIA, THE STOCK HAS

COME INTO A TEST OF RESISTANCE

AT THE 92 LEVEL.

IT'S A BIT LESS TACTICAL THAN IT

WAS, BUT WE THINK YOU WANT TO 

BUY PULL BACKS IN ANTICIPATION

FOR A BREAK OUT, AND LOOKING

THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE YEAR, 

WE SEE UP SIDE TO $250, THAT

BEING A KEY RESISTANCE LEVEL

FROM ABOUT A YEAR AGO.

>> LET'S MOVE ON TO STOCK NUMBER

TWO, AND THAT WOULD BE SPOTIFY, 

ARI.

>> OKAY.

SPO

 SPO

 SPOTIFY, A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE

MARKET ROTATING TO THE BEAR 

CYCLE'S BIGGEST LAGGARDS, WHICH 

IS A CHARACTERISTIC OF A MARKET,

JUNK RALLY, LOW MOMENTUM STOCKS,

YOU GOT IT BUY IT RIGHT, SELL IT

RIGHT.

YOU NEED A TIGHT STOP AS WELL.

THERE ARE LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL

CONCERNS IN THE CHART WE'RE 

WORRIED ABOUT.

IT'S A STOCK THAT'S MOVED ABOVE 

ITS 200 DAY AVERAGE FOR THE 

FIRST TIME IN A YEAR

AS LONG AS YOU'RE ABOVE TODAY'S 

GAP, LET'S CALL IT SUPPORT AT 

$99, THENEXT KEY RESISTANCE 

COMES IN AT 125, WHICH IS THE UP

SIDE THAT WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

OVER THE COMING WEEKS TO MONTHS.

>> ALL RIGHT

SO THAT BRINGS US TO SALESFORCE,

ARI, AND WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF

THIS ONE IS THIS. 

>> THIS WOULD BE A RELATIVE 

SELL

LISTEN, A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL 

BOATS.

IF WE'RE RIGHT ABOUT THE MARKET,

MOST LIKELY SALESFORCE RISES

WITH THE MARKET OVER THE COMING 

MONTHS

THE THING WITH SALESFORCE, WHY

WE'RE LESS CONVINCED ABOUT IT 

HAS BEEN RELATIVELY WEAKER

IT'S A STOCK THAT IS STILL

TRADING BELOW ITS 200-DAY MOVING

AVERAGE, WHICH IS SLOW GOING AS 

WELL

FOR THESE REASONS, WE WOULD 

PREFER TO SELL IT BINTO THAT 

RESISTANCE POINT AT $162, 

UNDE

UNDERSTANDING A RALLY ABOVE IT

WOULD BE AN INCREMENTAL 

POSITIVE

>> THANK YOU SO MUCH, AND SO, BY

THE WAY, ARI, HOW FAR DO YOU

THINK THIS BULLISHNESS ON THE 

MARKET OVERALL COULD EXTEND?

>> I'D BE PLAYING ALONG THE 

LINES THAT THIS IS THE START OF 

A BULL MARKET COMING OUT OF A 

NONRECESSIONARY BEAR MARKET.

IF YOU LOOK AT PERFORMANCE UNDER

THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE POST 

WAR ERA, TYPICALLY OVER THE 

FIRST 15 MONTHS, THE MARKET IS

UP ABOUT 25%

THAT STARTING POINT WOULD BE

OCTOBER OF '22, WHICH WE THINK

WAS THE LOW POINT OF THE CYCLE, 

BUT THAT GETS US TO 4,400 ON THE

S&P 500 THROUGH THE COURSE OF 

THE YEAR, SO WE DO STILL SEE
